/**
 * Demonstrates closure result caching through the memoize mechanism
 * Without caching the raw algorithm would end-up taking very long to finish given the inherent
 * exponential time complexity of it.
 * Thanks to caching introduced through memoize(), each Fibonacci number has to be calculated only once
 * and so we turned the exponential complexity algorithm into a sequential one. With a single extra method call.
