/**
 * Provides logical grouping for actors, agents and dataflow tasks and operators. Each group has an underlying thread pool, which will perform actions
 * on behalf of the users belonging to the group. Actors created through the DefaultPGroup.actor() method
 * will automatically belong to the group through which they were created, just like agents created through the agent() or fairAgent() methods
 * or dataflow tasks and operators created through the task() or operator() methods.
 * Uses a pool of non-daemon threads.
 * The DefaultPGroup class implements the Pool interface through @Delegate.
 * <pre>
 *
 * def group = new DefaultPGroup()
 * group.resize 1
 *
 * def actor = group.actor {*     react {message ->
 *         println message
 *}*}.start()
 *
 * actor.send 'Hi!'
 * ...
 * group.shutdown()
 * </pre>
 *
 * Otherwise, if constructing Actors directly through their constructors, the AbstractPooledActor.parallelGroup property,
 * which defaults to the Actors.defaultActorPGroup, can be set before the actor is started.
 *
 * <pre>
 * def group = new DefaultPGroup()
 *
 * def actor = new MyActor()
 * actor.parallelGroup = group
 * actor.start()
 * ...
 * group.shutdown()
 *
